      <h2>Food Order Errors</h2>
      <p>
        If you receive food that is different from your receipt, we sincerely apologize. Please call us as soon as you notice that there was an error in your order. You may come to pick up the correct food item. For credit card payments, you will be refunded the sales price amount associated with the error and recharged for the new item's price. For cash payments, you will be asked to pay the difference of the balance if the new food has a greater value than the food received in error. Similarly, you will receive the difference of the balance back as credit for the new item if it is less than the food received in error. In some cases, we may offer you store credit. Your order will be prioritized if you come to pick it up. In all cases, please return the food order in the original container(s) to our host.
      </p>

      <h2>Food Order Incomplete</h2>
      <p>
        In the rare occasion that you do not receive food that is on your receipt, we will make it up to you. Please call us as soon as you notice that any food items were not received in your order. You may cancel the missed food before we prepare it without any question, and we will refund the amount to a credit card, cash refund, or we will refund you with store credit.

      <h2>Food Dissatisfaction</h2>
      <p>
        We cook our food fresh to order with only the finest and freshest ingredients. We take great care and pride in all of the dishes we make. Please call us immediately if you receive unsatisfactory food caused by a dislike or objects in the food. We will need the food returned in the original container(s) so we may investigate and deal with the issue. We will prepare you a new food order. If you do not wish to receive a new dish, we may refund the amount to a credit card, cash refund, or we will refund you with store credit only after we receive the food in the original container(s) and have confirmed the error to the discretion of the manager on duty.
